Overview

Microsft has announced that we can now create more dynamic data pipelines using Azure Data Facotry (ADF) v2 by passing parameters between below:
  Pipelines
  Activities
  Datasets
  Linked Services

I have used key vault to store connection strings for Azure SQL Databases which makes it clean without any secret information. 

Hope this example helps you a lot.

If you have any questions, shoot me an email @ amarbold.s@gmail.com

Goodluck! and get your job dude.
